Design patterns are design level solutions for recurring problems that we software engineers come across often. It’s not code - I repeat, ****❌**CODE**. It is like a description on how to tackle these problems and design a solution.

Using these patterns is considered good practice, as the design of the solution is quite tried and tested, resulting in higher readability of the final code. Design patterns are quite often created for and used by OOP Languages, like Java

# **Types of design patterns**

There are about 26 Patterns currently discovered (I hardly think I will do them all…).

These 26 can be classified into 3 types:

1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.
